        <p class="lead mb-4">Ever since I was a child, Iâ€™ve been captivated by biology. On my fifth birthday, my father gifted me the kidâ€™s encyclopedia on biology. I would browse this encyclopedia at every opportunity I had, such as when I was eating, in the car, and even the restroom, although I could barely read. During my freshman year of high school, I took my first honors biology class, where I spent the year happily learning about ecology, genetics, and the human body. This reignited my interest in biology and was one of the reasons that led me to join academic decathlon, where the science topic for that year was immunobiology and infectious diseases. Not only did this reignition introduce me to the world of the academic decathlon, but also led me to find my niche in the vast world of biology. I loved reading about diseases such as Ebola and Malaria and how to prevent/treat them. I covered the walls of my room with diagrams of the human anatomy and saved up money to afford a weekly subscription for the Lancet, a medical journal I would read while googling all the medical terms I wasn't familiar with. Even after the AcaDec state competition in Sacramento, California, I continued learning more and more about the human body's immune system. But I didnâ€™t strictly contain my love for biology in the school environment â€” I decided to experience biology first-hand.  Ever since my decision, I have volunteered at my local hospital's laboratory department, where I run blood samples and help phlebotomists test them by fractionating the blood using a centrifuge. I also learned about different methods of diagnosis for several types of diseases, such as using the CD4 cell count as an accurate method of diagnosis for AIDS. Finally, in my senior year, I finally felt motivated enough to take AP Biology, one of the few classes I have thoroughly enjoyed in my high school career. Now as a first year Biology major at the University of California, Riverside, I am learning more about this awesome subject each and every day. I learned some laboratory basics in Dynamic Genome, and now learning basic biology in Biology 5A and 5B. As a current biology major planning on specializing in medicine, I hope to further my knowledge in this field, as well as my interest in this subject.
